1. Takes data in — from you (the user), other companies, and data it collects itself
2. Groups it — into segments, mainly, which DMPs insist on calling “audiences” because they are obsessed with pretending they work in television
3.    Sends instructions — to place ads (usually via its wingman, the Demand-Side Platform [DSP]), change the content on a web page or email, etc.
4.    Measures the impact; improves the instructions

(1) data wrangler, (2) media person, (3) marketing operations, and (4) analytics ninja.


To understand the soul of the DMP, we will need to get into:

* How it collects information [note: you can substitute the word “data” for “information” if you like: personally, I’m tired of hearing the word data and think we all need a break]
*    How it defines and maintains information
*    What audiences are
*    How decisions are made, and
*    What the analytics looks like.
